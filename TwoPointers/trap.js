Trapping Rain Water | Hard
You are given an array non-negative integers heights which represent an elevation map. Each value heights[i] 
represents the height of a bar, which has a width of 1.

Return the maximum area of water that can be trapped between the bars.

Example 1:

Input: height = [0,2,0,3,1,0,1,3,2,1]

Output: 9

Constraints:

1 <= height.length <= 1000
0 <= height[i] <= 1000
*/
class Solution {
    /**
     * @param {number[]} height
     * @return {number}
     */
    trap(height) { }
}
