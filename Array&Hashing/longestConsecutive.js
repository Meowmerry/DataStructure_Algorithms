Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,20,4,10,3,4,5]

Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [2, 3, 4, 5].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1]

Output: 7
Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

class Solution {
    /**
     * @param {number[]} nums
     * @return {number}
     */
    longestConsecutive(nums) { }
}
